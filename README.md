## First Semester Processing Calculator
##### Completed Nov. 2018
Object oriented calculator with features including... man I don't know, why am I trying to be all professional here? It's a basic calculator that resembles a Nokia I guess.

## ZOOG
##### ZOOG ZOOGED Oct. 2018
ZOOG is a ZOOG that ZOOGS. Make sure you don't pronounce it ZOOG, because that means testicles.
